# Completed Projects

Here are some of the projects I have completed in the fields of machine learning, data analytics, and control theory.

## Project Overview

| Project Title | Description | Libraries Used |
| :---------------------- | :---------------------- | :---------------------- |
| [Development of a Vehicle Path Tracking Control Algorithm](nmpc_trajectory_tracking) | Development of a mathematical model for a vehicle and an automatic control system for the vehicle to travel along a predefined trajectory using the NMPC (nonlinear model predictive control) method. | *numpy*, *casadi*, *scipy*, *matplotlib* |
| [Gold Recovery Rate Estimation from Ore](gold_recovery_rate) | Development of a prototype machine learning model for a company providing solutions to improve industrial efficiency. The model predicts the gold recovery rate from gold-containing ore based on data related to mining and purification processes. Model performance is evaluated using the sMAPE metric. | *pandas*, *numpy*, *sklearn*, *plotly* |
| [Steel Exit Temperature Prediction](steel_temp_modeling) | A metallurgical plant aimed to reduce electricity consumption during steel processing. A model is required to predict the steel temperature at the ladle exit. The model should predict the temperature with a specified MAE (Mean Absolute Error) precision. | *pandas*, *numpy*, *sklearn*, *matplotlib*, *seaborn*, *xgboost*, *catboost* |
| [Toxic Comment Detection](nlp_toxic_comments) | Training a model to classify comments as either positive or negative (toxic). The dataset consists of comments labeled with toxicity levels. The F1 score is used as the performance metric. Lemmatization and TF-IDF vectorization were applied to the text data for this task. | *pandas*, *numpy*, *re*, *nltk*, *sklearn*, *xgboost*, *catboost* |
